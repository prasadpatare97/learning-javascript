* **What the tool does:** This tool takes input text, returns character count, word count and sentence count of the text. It also provide functionality to make changes to the text like changing case, removing extra spaces etc.
* **What problem it solves:** This tool helps to analyze a text input quickly, giving information about characters, characters excluding spaces, number of words, and number of sentences. It also helps to make quick changes to the text like turning it to upper case, lower case, transforming into title format capitalization, sentence format capitalization etc.
* **What JS concepts are used:** The Java Script concepts used are
* DOM Selection \& Manipulation:
* Accessing and updating UI elements using document.getElementById
* Event-Driven Programming:
* Handling user interactions via click and input event listeners
* Variables \& Block Scoping:
* Using const and let appropriately for predictable state management
* Functions \& Reusability:
* Extracting repeated logic into reusable, single-responsibility functions
* Arrow Functions:
* Using concise callback functions for event handling
* String Processing \& Text Manipulation:
* Character-level text transformations using split, join, and case methods
* Regular Expressions:
* Pattern-based detection of letters, whitespace, and sentence boundaries
* Loops \& Iterative Processing:
* Controlled character-by-character iteration using for loops
* State Flags (Finite-State Logic):
* Tracking context such as word starts, sentence boundaries, and spacing
* Conditional Logic:
* Applying branching logic for safe and accurate text transformations
* Array Methods:
* Using filter for data cleanup and accurate counting
* Separation of Concerns:
* Decoupling UI events, business logic, and DOM updates for maintainability
* Defensive \& Reliable Coding:
* Guarding against invalid inputs to prevent runtime errors
* Intent-Driven Commenting:
* Writing comments that explain why decisions exist, not what the code does
